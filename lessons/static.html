<h2>static Keyword in Java</h2>

<p>
The <b>static</b> keyword in Java is used to
define class‑level members.
</p>

<p>
A static member belongs to the <b>class</b>,
not to individual objects.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Why Do We Need the static Keyword?</h2>

<p>
Normally, each object has its own copy
of instance variables.
</p>

<p>
The <b>static</b> keyword allows sharing
a single copy of a variable or method
among all objects of a class.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>static Variable</h2>

<p>
A <b>static variable</b> is shared by
all objects of the class.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
class Student {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;int id;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;static String college = "ABC College";<br>
}
</p>

<p>
Here:
<br>
✔ id → Instance variable (separate for each object)<br>
✔ college → Static variable (shared)
</p>

<hr>

<h2>static Method</h2>

<p>
A <b>static method</b> belongs to the class
and can be called without creating an object.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
class Demo {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;static void show() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Static Method");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}
</p>

<p>
Calling static method:
</p>

<p>
Demo.show();
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Rules of static Method</h2>

<p>
✔ Can access only static members directly<br>
✔ Cannot use <b>this</b> keyword<br>
✔ Called using class name
</p>

<hr>

<h2>static Block</h2>

<p>
A <b>static block</b> is used to initialize
static variables.
</p>

<p>
It is executed <b>once</b> when the class
is loaded into memory.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
class Demo {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;static {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Static Block Executed");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Order of Execution</h2>

<p>
✔ Static block → executed first<br>
✔ main() method → executed next<br>
✔ Constructors → executed when object is created
</p>

<hr>

<h2>static vs Instance Members</h2>

<p>
✔ static → Belongs to class<br>
✔ Instance → Belongs to object<br><br>
✔ static → Single copy shared<br>
✔ Instance → Separate copy per object
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Memory Allocation</h2>

<p>
Static members are stored in the
<b>Class Area / Method Area</b>.
</p>

<p>
They are loaded only once,
saving memory.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Real-Time Examples</h2>

<p>
✔ Math.PI (constant value)<br>
✔ Utility methods (Collections.sort())<br>
✔ Counter variables shared across objects
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

<p>
✔ Using this inside static method<br>
✔ Accessing instance variables directly in static method<br>
✔ Creating object just to access static members
</p>

<h2>static Keyword (Interview / Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
The <b>static</b> keyword in Java is used to
define class-level variables, methods, and blocks.
Static members are shared among all objects,
loaded once into memory, and can be accessed
using the class name without creating objects.
