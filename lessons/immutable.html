<h2>Immutable Strings in Java</h2>

<p>
In Java, a <b>String</b> is <b>immutable</b>.
Immutable means <b>unchangeable</b>.
</p>

<p>
Once a String object is created,
its value <b>cannot be modified</b>.
Any change creates a new String object.
</p>

<h2>What Does Immutability Mean?</h2>

<p>
Immutability means:
<br>
✔ The content of a String cannot be changed<br>
✔ Any modification creates a new object<br>
✔ The original String remains unchanged
</p>

<h2>Example of Immutable String</h2>

<p>
String s = "Java";<br>
s.concat(" Programming");<br>
System.out.println(s);
</p>

<p>
Output:
<br>
Java
</p>

<p>
Explanation:
<br>
✔ concat() creates a new String object<br>
✔ The new object is not assigned to any reference<br>
✔ Original string remains unchanged
</p>

<h2>Correct Way to Modify a String</h2>

<p>
String s = "Java";<br>
s = s.concat(" Programming");<br>
System.out.println(s);
</p>

<p>
Output:
<br>
Java Programming
</p>

<h2>Why Are Strings Immutable in Java?</h2>

<h3>1. Security</h3>

<p>
Strings are used in:
<br>
✔ Passwords<br>
✔ Database URLs<br>
✔ Network connections
</p>

<p>
If Strings were mutable, attackers
could change sensitive data.
</p>

<h3>2. String Constant Pool (SCP)</h3>

<p>
String literals are stored in the
<b>String Constant Pool</b>.
</p>

<p>
Multiple references can point
to the same String object.
</p>

<p>
Immutability ensures that one reference
cannot change the value for others.
</p>

<h3>3. Thread Safety</h3>

<p>
Because Strings cannot be modified,
they are naturally thread-safe.
</p>

<p>
Multiple threads can safely share
the same String object.
</p>

<h3>4. Performance & Hashing</h3>

<p>
String hashcode is cached.
</p>

<p>
Immutability ensures the hashcode
does not change, improving performance
in collections like HashMap.
</p>

<h2>Memory Diagram Explanation</h2>

<p>
String s1 = "Java";<br>
String s2 = s1.concat(" Programming");
</p>

<p>
✔ "Java" remains in SCP<br>
✔ "Java Programming" is a new object<br>
✔ s1 and s2 point to different objects
</p>

<h2>Immutable vs Mutable Strings</h2>

<p>
✔ String → Immutable<br>
✔ StringBuffer → Mutable<br>
✔ StringBuilder → Mutable
</p>

<h2>When Immutability is a Problem?</h2>

<p>
Immutability causes performance issues
when:
<br>
✔ Strings are modified repeatedly<br>
✔ Concatenation happens inside loops
</p>

<p>
In such cases, use:
<br>
✔ StringBuilder (fast)<br>
✔ StringBuffer (thread-safe)
</p>

<h2>Real-Time Examples</h2>

<p>
Immutable Strings are useful in:
<br>
✔ Login systems<br>
✔ Configuration values<br>
✔ Constants and keys<br>
✔ Multi-threaded applications
</p>

<h2>Common Interview Questions</h2>

<p>
✔ Why is String immutable?<br>
✔ Can String be made mutable?<br>
✔ Difference between String and StringBuilder?
</p>

<h2>Immutable Strings (Interview / Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
In Java, Strings are immutable, meaning
once a String object is created, its value
cannot be changed. Any modification creates
a new object, providing security, thread safety,
and better performance through the
String Constant Pool.
