<h2>Abstraction in Java</h2>

<p>
<b>Abstraction</b> is one of the core
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
</p>

<p>
Abstraction means <b>hiding implementation details</b>
and showing only <b>essential features</b> to the user.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>What is Abstraction?</h2>

<p>
Abstraction focuses on <b>what an object does</b>
rather than <b>how it does it</b>.
</p>

<p>
It helps reduce complexity and
improves code maintainability.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Why Do We Need Abstraction?</h2>

<p>
Abstraction provides:
<br>
✔ Security (hide internal logic)<br>
✔ Reduced complexity<br>
✔ Loose coupling<br>
✔ Easy maintenance and scalability
</p>

<hr>

<h2>How to Achieve Abstraction in Java?</h2>

<p>
In Java, abstraction is achieved using:
<br>
✔ <b>Abstract Class</b><br>
✔ <b>Interface</b>
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Abstract Class</h2>

<p>
An <b>abstract class</b> is a class
that is declared using the <b>abstract</b> keyword.
</p>

<p>
Features:
<br>
✔ Can have abstract methods (no body)<br>
✔ Can have concrete methods (with body)<br>
✔ Cannot be instantiated
</p>

<h3>Example of Abstract Class</h3>

<p>
abstract class Vehicle {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;abstract void start();<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;void fuel() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Fuel is required");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}
</p>

<p>
class Car extends Vehicle {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;void start() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Car starts with key");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Abstract Method</h2>

<p>
An <b>abstract method</b> is a method
that does not have a body.
</p>

<p>
It must be implemented by child classes.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<p>
abstract void start();
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Rules of Abstract Class</h2>

<p>
✔ Abstract class can have constructors<br>
✔ Abstract class can have static methods<br>
✔ If a class has an abstract method, class must be abstract<br>
✔ Child class must implement all abstract methods
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Abstraction Using Interface (Overview)</h2>

<p>
An <b>interface</b> provides complete abstraction.
</p>

<p>
It contains abstract methods by default
(before Java 8).
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<p>
interface Shape {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;void draw();<br>
}
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Abstraction vs Encapsulation</h2>

<p>
✔ Abstraction → Hides implementation details<br>
✔ Encapsulation → Hides data using access modifiers
</p>

<p>
✔ Abstraction → Focus on design<br>
✔ Encapsulation → Focus on security
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Real-Time Examples</h2>

<p>
✔ ATM → User knows withdraw(), not internal process<br>
✔ Car → User drives, doesn't know engine logic<br>
✔ Mobile → User taps icons, OS handles logic
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Advantages of Abstraction</h2>

<p>
✔ Improves code flexibility<br>
✔ Supports scalability<br>
✔ Enhances security<br>
✔ Reduces code dependency
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

<p>
✔ Trying to create object of abstract class<br>
✔ Not implementing abstract methods in child class<br>
✔ Confusing abstraction with encapsulation
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Abstraction (Interview / Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
Abstraction in Java is an OOP concept that hides
implementation details and shows only essential
features to the user. It is achieved using
abstract classes and interfaces, improving
security, flexibility, and maintainability.
