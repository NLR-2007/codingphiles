<h2>Thread Class in Java</h2>

<p>
The <b>Thread</b> class in Java is used
to create and control threads.
</p>

<p>
It is present in the <b>java.lang</b> package
and provides built‑in support for
<b>multithreading</b>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>What is Thread Class?</h2>

<p>
The <b>Thread</b> class represents a
thread of execution in a Java program.
</p>

<p>
✔ Each thread is an instance of Thread class<br>
✔ JVM schedules threads for execution
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Why Thread Class?</h2>

<p>
Thread class is used to:
</p>

<p>
✔ Create threads<br>
✔ Start thread execution<br>
✔ Control thread behavior<br>
✔ Manage thread life cycle
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Creating Thread Using Thread Class</h2>

<p>
Steps:
</p>

<p>
✔ Extend Thread class<br>
✔ Override run() method<br>
✔ Create object of class<br>
✔ Call start()
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Example: Extending Thread Class</h2>

<p>
class MyThread extends Thread {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;public void run() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Thread is running");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}<br><br>
class Test {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MyThread t = new MyThread();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t.start();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}
</p>

<hr>

<h2>start() vs run()</h2>

<p>
✔ start() → Creates new thread and executes run()<br>
✔ run() → Executes like normal method
</p>

<p>
⚠ Always use start() to begin a new thread
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Important Methods of Thread Class</h2>

<p>
Commonly used Thread class methods:
</p>

<p>
✔ start()<br>
✔ run()<br>
✔ sleep()<br>
✔ join()<br>
✔ getName()<br>
✔ setName()<br>
✔ getPriority()<br>
✔ setPriority()<br>
✔ isAlive()<br>
✔ currentThread()
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Thread sleep()</h2>

<p>
Pauses execution of current thread
for specified time.
</p>

<p>
Thread.sleep(1000); // 1 second
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Thread join()</h2>

<p>
Makes one thread wait for another
thread to finish execution.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Thread Priority</h2>

<p>
Thread priority decides execution preference.
</p>

<p>
✔ MIN_PRIORITY → 1<br>
✔ NORM_PRIORITY → 5<br>
✔ MAX_PRIORITY → 10
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Thread currentThread()</h2>

<p>
Returns reference to currently executing thread.
</p>

<p>
Thread t = Thread.currentThread();
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Thread isAlive()</h2>

<p>
Checks whether a thread is alive.
</p>

<p>
✔ true → thread is running or ready<br>
✔ false → thread is terminated
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Thread Class vs Runnable Interface</h2>

<p>
✔ Thread → Inherits Thread class<br>
✔ Runnable → Implements Runnable interface<br><br>
✔ Thread → Cannot extend another class<br>
✔ Runnable → Can extend another class<br><br>
✔ Runnable → Preferred approach
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Limitations of Thread Class</h2>

<p>
✔ Java does not support multiple inheritance<br>
✔ Extending Thread blocks extending other classes
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Real‑Time Examples</h2>

<p>
✔ File download threads<br>
✔ Game animation threads<br>
✔ Background services<br>
✔ Server request handling
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

<p>
✔ Calling run() instead of start()<br>
✔ Calling start() twice<br>
✔ Ignoring thread synchronization
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Thread Class (Interview / Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
The Thread class in Java is used to create
and manage threads. A thread can be created
by extending the Thread class and overriding
the run() method. The start() method is used
to begin execution, and the Thread class
provides several methods to control thread
behavior and life cycle.
