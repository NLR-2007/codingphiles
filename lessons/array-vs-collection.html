<h2>Array vs Collection in Java</h2>

<p>
In Java, <b>Arrays</b> and <b>Collections</b>
are both used to store multiple values,
but they are designed for different purposes.
</p>

<p>
Understanding the difference between arrays
and collections is very important for
writing efficient and industry‑level Java code.
</p>

<h2>What is an Array?</h2>

<p>
An <b>Array</b> is a fixed‑size data structure
that stores elements of the same data type.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<p>
int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30};
</p>

<h2>What is a Collection?</h2>

<p>
A <b>Collection</b> is a dynamic data structure
provided by the Java Collections Framework.
</p>

<p>
Collections can grow or shrink in size
during program execution.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<p>
ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();<br>
list.add(10);<br>
list.add(20);
</p>

<h2>Key Differences Between Array and Collection</h2>

<h3>1. Size</h3>

<p>
✔ Array → Fixed size<br>
✔ Collection → Dynamic size
</p>

<h3>2. Data Type</h3>

<p>
✔ Array → Can store primitive and objects<br>
✔ Collection → Stores only objects
</p>

<h3>3. Performance</h3>

<p>
✔ Array → Faster access<br>
✔ Collection → Slightly slower due to overhead
</p>

<h3>4. Memory</h3>

<p>
✔ Array → Less memory overhead<br>
✔ Collection → More memory due to additional features
</p>

<h3>5. Functionality</h3>

<p>
✔ Array → Limited methods<br>
✔ Collection → Rich set of methods (add, remove, search, sort)
</p>

<h2>Example Comparison</h2>

<h3>Using Array</h3>

<p>
int[] arr = new int[3];<br>
arr[0] = 10;<br>
arr[1] = 20;<br>
arr[2] = 30;
</p>

<h3>Using Collection (ArrayList)</h3>

<p>
ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();<br>
list.add(10);<br>
list.add(20);<br>
list.add(30);
</p>

<h2>When to Use Array?</h2>

<p>
Use arrays when:
<br>
✔ Size is fixed<br>
✔ Performance is critical<br>
✔ Simple data storage is required
</p>

<h2>When to Use Collection?</h2>

<p>
Use collections when:
<br>
✔ Size changes dynamically<br>
✔ Frequent insertion and deletion is needed<br>
✔ Advanced operations are required
</p>

<h2>Real‑Time Usage</h2>

<p>
Arrays are used in:
<br>
✔ Low‑level programming<br>
✔ Performance‑critical applications
</p>

<p>
Collections are used in:
<br>
✔ Enterprise applications<br>
✔ Data processing systems<br>
✔ Real‑world business logic
</p>

<h2>Advantages of Array</h2>

<p>
✔ Simple structure<br>
✔ Fast access<br>
✔ Less memory usage
</p>

<h2>Advantages of Collection</h2>

<p>
✔ Dynamic resizing<br>
✔ Built‑in methods<br>
✔ Flexible and powerful
</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>
Array Limitations:
<br>
✔ Fixed size<br>
✔ No built‑in utilities
</p>

<p>
Collection Limitations:
<br>
✔ Cannot store primitive types directly<br>
✔ Slight performance overhead
</p>

<h2>Array vs Collection (Interview / Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
Arrays are fixed‑size data structures
that can store primitive and object types,
while Collections are dynamic data structures
that store objects and provide rich utility methods
for data manipulation.
</p>
