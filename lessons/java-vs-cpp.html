<h2>Java vs C++</h2>

<p>
Java and C++ are both powerful programming languages,
but they differ in design, features, and usage.
</p>

<p>
C++ is an extension of C with object-oriented features,
while Java was designed from scratch to be object-oriented,
secure, and platform independent.
</p>

<h2>Programming Paradigm</h2>

<p>
<b>C++:</b><br>
✔ Supports both procedural and object-oriented programming<br>
✔ Allows low-level and high-level programming
</p>

<p>
<b>Java:</b><br>
✔ Pure object-oriented programming language<br>
✔ Everything is based on classes and objects
</p>

<h2>Platform Dependency</h2>

<p>
<b>C++:</b><br>
✔ Platform dependent<br>
✔ Programs must be compiled separately for each operating system
</p>

<p>
<b>Java:</b><br>
✔ Platform independent<br>
✔ Uses bytecode and JVM to run on any platform
</p>

<h2>Compilation and Execution</h2>

<p>
<b>C++:</b><br>
✔ Source code compiled directly into machine code<br>
✔ Executes directly on hardware
</p>

<p>
<b>Java:</b><br>
✔ Source code compiled into bytecode (.class file)<br>
✔ Bytecode executed by JVM
</p>

<h2>Memory Management</h2>

<p>
<b>C++:</b><br>
✔ Manual memory management<br>
✔ Uses new and delete operators<br>
✔ Higher risk of memory leaks
</p>

<p>
<b>Java:</b><br>
✔ Automatic memory management<br>
✔ Uses Garbage Collector<br>
✔ Safer and more reliable
</p>

<h2>Pointers</h2>

<p>
<b>C++:</b><br>
✔ Supports pointers<br>
✔ Allows direct memory manipulation
</p>

<p>
<b>Java:</b><br>
✔ Does not support pointers directly<br>
✔ Improves security and stability
</p>

<h2>Multiple Inheritance</h2>

<p>
<b>C++:</b><br>
✔ Supports multiple inheritance using classes
</p>

<p>
<b>Java:</b><br>
✔ Does not support multiple inheritance using classes<br>
✔ Achieves it using interfaces
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>
<b>C++:</b><br>
✔ Less secure<br>
✔ Vulnerable to memory-related issues
</p>

<p>
<b>Java:</b><br>
✔ Highly secure<br>
✔ Uses bytecode verification and security manager
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>
<b>C++:</b><br>
✔ Faster execution<br>
✔ Suitable for system-level programming
</p>

<p>
<b>Java:</b><br>
✔ Slightly slower than C++<br>
✔ Performance improved using JIT compiler
</p>

<h2>Portability</h2>

<p>
<b>C++:</b><br>
✔ Less portable<br>
✔ Platform-specific code required
</p>

<p>
<b>Java:</b><br>
✔ Highly portable<br>
✔ Same bytecode runs on all platforms
</p>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>

<p>
<b>C++ is used for:</b><br>
✔ Operating systems<br>
✔ Game engines<br>
✔ Embedded systems
</p>

<p>
<b>Java is used for:</b><br>
✔ Web applications<br>
✔ Android applications<br>
✔ Enterprise systems
</p>

<h2>Ease of Learning</h2>

<p>
<b>C++:</b><br>
✔ Difficult to learn<br>
✔ Requires understanding of pointers and memory
</p>

<p>
<b>Java:</b><br>
✔ Easier to learn<br>
✔ Automatic memory management helps beginners
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
✔ C++ provides high performance and low-level control<br>
✔ Java provides security, portability, and ease of use
</p>

<h2>Java vs C++ (Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent language
that uses JVM and automatic garbage collection, whereas C++ is a
platform-dependent language that provides manual memory management,
pointers, and higher performance with lower security.
