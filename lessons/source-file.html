<h2>Java Source File Rules</h2>

<p>
Java source files must follow certain rules
to compile and execute successfully.
</p>

<h2>Important Rules</h2>

<p>
✔ File extension must be <b>.java</b><br>
✔ Public class name must match file name<br>
✔ Only one public class per file<br>
✔ main() must be inside a class
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>
✔ Correct: Hello.java → public class Hello<br>
✖ Incorrect: Test.java → public class Demo
</p>

<h2>Why Rules Matter</h2>

<p>
Breaking source file rules causes
compilation errors.
</p>

<h2>Java Source File Rules (Exam Ready)</h2>

A Java source file must follow naming rules
and contain at most one public class.
