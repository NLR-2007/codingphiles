<h2>Platform Independence in Java</h2>

<p>
Platform independence is one of the most important features of Java.
</p>

<p>
Platform independence means that a Java program can run on
different operating systems without changing the code.
</p>

<h2>What is a Platform?</h2>

<p>
A platform refers to the combination of:
<br>
✔ Operating System (Windows, Linux, Mac)<br>
✔ Hardware (CPU architecture)
</p>

<p>
Normally, programs written for one platform do not work on another.
</p>

<h2>Problem with Traditional Languages</h2>

<p>
Languages like C and C++ are platform dependent.
</p>

<p>
This means:
<br>
✔ Code compiled on Windows will not run on Linux<br>
✔ Separate compilation is required for each OS<br>
✔ Maintenance becomes difficult
</p>

<h2>How Java Achieves Platform Independence</h2>

<p>
Java achieves platform independence using:
<br>
✔ Bytecode<br>
✔ Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
</p>

<h2>Role of Bytecode</h2>

<p>
When Java source code is compiled, it is converted into
an intermediate form called <b>bytecode</b>.
</p>

<p>
Bytecode:
<br>
✔ Is not machine specific<br>
✔ Is the same on all platforms<br>
✔ Can run on any system with JVM
</p>

<h2>Role of JVM</h2>

<p>
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is responsible for executing bytecode.
</p>

<p>
Each operating system has its own JVM implementation.
</p>

<p>
Examples:
<br>
✔ JVM for Windows<br>
✔ JVM for Linux<br>
✔ JVM for Mac OS
</p>

<p>
The JVM converts bytecode into machine-specific instructions.
</p>

<h2>Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)</h2>

<p>
Java follows the principle:
<br>
<b>Write Once, Run Anywhere</b>
</p>

<p>
This means:
<br>
✔ Write code once<br>
✔ Compile once<br>
✔ Run on any platform with JVM
</p>

<h2>Java Execution Flow for Platform Independence</h2>

<p>
The flow is:
<br>
✔ Java Source Code (.java)<br>
✔ Java Compiler (javac)<br>
✔ Bytecode (.class)<br>
✔ JVM<br>
✔ Operating System
</p>

<h2>Why Java is Not 100% Platform Independent</h2>

<p>
Java is mostly platform independent, but not completely.
</p>

<p>
Reasons:
<br>
✔ Some native libraries are OS dependent<br>
✔ GUI look and feel may vary across platforms
</p>

<p>
However, core Java programs remain portable.
</p>

<h2>Advantages of Platform Independence</h2>

<p>
✔ No need to rewrite code for different platforms<br>
✔ Easy software maintenance<br>
✔ Cost-effective development<br>
✔ Wide user reach
</p>

<h2>Real-World Example</h2>

<p>
A Java application developed on Windows can be deployed
on Linux servers without modifying the code.
</p>

<h2>Platform Independence vs Portability</h2>

<p>
Platform independence means execution without modification.
</p>

<p>
Portability means easy adaptation with minimal changes.
</p>

<p>
Java provides both platform independence and portability.
</p>

<h2>Platform Independence in Java (Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
Platform independence in Java means that Java programs are compiled
into bytecode, which can run on any operating system using the JVM,
allowing the same program to execute without modification.
