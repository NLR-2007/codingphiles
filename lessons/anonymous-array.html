<h2>Anonymous Array in Java</h2>

<p>
An <b>Anonymous Array</b> in Java is an array
that is created without assigning it to a variable.
</p>

<p>
It is mainly used when an array is required
only once, usually at the time of method calling.
</p>

<h2>Why is it called Anonymous Array?</h2>

<p>
It is called anonymous because:
<br>
✔ No reference variable is used<br>
✔ The array has no name<br>
✔ It is used directly
</p>

<h2>Syntax of Anonymous Array</h2>

<p>
new dataType[] { value1, value2, value3, ... }
</p>

<h2>Example of Anonymous Array</h2>

<p>
System.out.println(new int[] {10, 20, 30}[1]);
</p>

<p>
Output:
<br>
20
</p>

<h2>Anonymous Array with Method</h2>

<p>
Anonymous arrays are most commonly
used while passing data to methods.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
class Test {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;static void printArray(int[] arr) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for(int i : arr) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(i);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printArray(new int[] {5, 10, 15});<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}
</p>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

<p>
✔ Array is created at runtime<br>
✔ Passed directly to the method<br>
✔ No variable is declared
</p>

<h2>Anonymous Array in 2D</h2>

<p>
Anonymous arrays can also be used
with two dimensional arrays.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<p>
printMatrix(new int[][] {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;{1, 2},<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;{3, 4}<br>
});
</p>

<h2>When to Use Anonymous Arrays?</h2>

<p>
Anonymous arrays are useful when:
<br>
✔ Array is used only once<br>
✔ Temporary data is needed<br>
✔ Clean and short code is preferred
</p>

<h2>Advantages of Anonymous Array</h2>

<p>
✔ No need to declare a variable<br>
✔ Saves memory for short‑term usage<br>
✔ Makes code concise
</p>

<h2>Limitations of Anonymous Array</h2>

<p>
✔ Cannot reuse the array<br>
✔ Hard to debug for beginners<br>
✔ Not suitable for complex logic
</p>

<h2>Real‑Time Use Cases</h2>

<p>
Anonymous arrays are used in:
<br>
✔ Method calls with fixed values<br>
✔ Test cases<br>
✔ One‑time calculations
</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

<p>
✔ Trying to reuse anonymous array<br>
✔ Using it for large datasets<br>
✔ Overusing and reducing readability
</p>

<h2>Anonymous Array (Interview / Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
An anonymous array in Java is an array
created without a reference variable
and is mainly used for one‑time operations,
especially while passing values to methods.
