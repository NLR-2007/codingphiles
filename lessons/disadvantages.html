<h2>Disadvantages of Java</h2>

<p>
Although Java is a powerful and popular programming language,
it also has some disadvantages.
</p>

<p>
Understanding these limitations helps developers choose
the right technology for a given application.
</p>

<h2>Slower Performance Compared to Low-Level Languages</h2>

<p>
Java programs are generally slower than programs written in
languages like C or C++.
</p>

<p>
Reason:
<br>
✔ Java uses JVM<br>
✔ Code is executed through bytecode<br>
✔ Additional abstraction layers exist
</p>

<p>
However, JIT compiler helps reduce this issue.
</p>

<h2>High Memory Consumption</h2>

<p>
Java applications consume more memory compared to some
other programming languages.
</p>

<p>
Reasons:
<br>
✔ JVM requires additional memory<br>
✔ Garbage Collection overhead<br>
✔ Object-oriented design uses more memory
</p>

<h2>Garbage Collection Overhead</h2>

<p>
Java uses automatic garbage collection to manage memory.
</p>

<p>
Disadvantage:
<br>
✔ Garbage Collector may pause the application<br>
✔ Not fully controllable by the programmer
</p>

<p>
This can affect performance in real-time systems.
</p>

<h2>No Control Over Hardware</h2>

<p>
Java does not allow direct access to hardware resources.
</p>

<p>
Limitations:
<br>
✔ No pointer arithmetic<br>
✔ Limited low-level memory control
</p>

<p>
Because of this, Java is not suitable for system-level programming.
</p>

<h2>Verbose Code</h2>

<p>
Java programs often require more lines of code
to perform simple tasks.
</p>

<p>
Compared to languages like Python,
Java code can be lengthy and repetitive.
</p>

<h2>Not Suitable for Real-Time Applications</h2>

<p>
Java is not ideal for real-time applications
where strict timing constraints exist.
</p>

<p>
Reasons:
<br>
✔ Unpredictable garbage collection pauses<br>
✔ JVM overhead
</p>

<p>
Examples:
<br>
✔ Embedded real-time systems<br>
✔ Low-latency control systems
</p>

<h2>Dependency on JVM</h2>

<p>
Java programs require a Java Virtual Machine to run.
</p>

<p>
Disadvantages:
<br>
✔ JVM must be installed on the system<br>
✔ Increases deployment complexity
</p>

<h2>Startup Time is Slower</h2>

<p>
Java applications take more time to start
compared to native applications.
</p>

<p>
Reason:
<br>
✔ JVM initialization<br>
✔ Class loading process
</p>

<h2>Limited Use in Low-Level Programming</h2>

<p>
Java is not suitable for:
<br>
✔ Operating system development<br>
✔ Device drivers<br>
✔ Embedded firmware
</p>

<p>
These areas require direct hardware control.
</p>

<h2>GUI Look and Feel Issues</h2>

<p>
Java GUI applications may not always match
the native look and feel of the operating system.
</p>

<p>
This can affect user experience in desktop applications.
</p>

<h2>Why Java Is Still Widely Used</h2>

<p>
Despite these disadvantages, Java is still popular because:
<br>
✔ Platform independence<br>
✔ Security<br>
✔ Scalability<br>
✔ Strong community support
</p>

<h2>Disadvantages of Java (Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
The disadvantages of Java include slower performance compared
to low-level languages, higher memory consumption, garbage
collection overhead, dependency on JVM, verbose syntax, and
limited suitability for real-time and low-level programming.
