<h2>Features of Java</h2>

<p>
Java provides many powerful features that make it one of the most popular
programming languages in the world.
</p>

<p>
These features make Java simple, secure, portable, and suitable for
small as well as large applications.
</p>
<h2>1. Simple</h2>

<p>
Java is simple because:
</p>

<p>
✔ Easy-to-understand syntax<br>
✔ No complex features like pointers<br>
✔ Automatic memory management<br>
✔ Clear structure and rules
</p>

<p>
Java removes complicated concepts present in languages like C and C++,
making it beginner-friendly.
</p>
<h2>2. Object-Oriented</h2>

<p>
Java is an object-oriented programming language.
</p>

<p>
It follows OOP concepts such as:
<br>
✔ Class and Object<br>
✔ Encapsulation<br>
✔ Inheritance<br>
✔ Polymorphism<br>
✔ Abstraction
</p>

<p>
Object-oriented design helps in code reusability, security, and easy maintenance.
</p>
<h2>3. Platform Independent</h2>

<p>
Java programs do not depend on any specific operating system.
</p>

<p>
Java source code is compiled into <b>bytecode</b>,
which can run on any system that has a <b>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</b>.
</p>

<p>
This is known as:
<br>
<b>Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)</b>
</p>
<h2>4. Secure</h2>

<p>
Java provides a strong security system.
</p>

<p>
Security features include:
<br>
✔ No direct memory access<br>
✔ Bytecode verification<br>
✔ Secure class loader<br>
✔ Runtime security checks
</p>

<p>
Because of this, Java is widely used in banking and enterprise systems.
</p>

<h2>5. Robust</h2>

<p>
Java is a robust language, meaning it is strong and reliable.
</p>

<p>
Java achieves robustness through:
<br>
✔ Strong memory management<br>
✔ Automatic garbage collection<br>
✔ Exception handling mechanism<br>
✔ Type checking at compile time
</p>

<p>
These features help prevent crashes and runtime errors.
</p>
<h2>6. Multithreaded</h2>

<p>
Java supports multithreading, which allows multiple tasks
to run at the same time.
</p>

<p>
Examples:
<br>
✔ Playing music while downloading a file<br>
✔ Running background tasks in applications
</p>

<p>
Multithreading improves performance and responsiveness.
</p>
<h2>7. High Performance</h2>

<p>
Java provides high performance using:
</p>

<p>
✔ Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler<br>
✔ Optimized bytecode execution
</p>

<p>
The JIT compiler converts bytecode into machine code at runtime,
making Java faster than traditional interpreted languages.
</p>
<h2>8. Distributed</h2>

<p>
Java supports distributed applications.
</p>

<p>
It allows programs to communicate over a network using:
<br>
✔ APIs for networking<br>
✔ Remote Method Invocation (RMI)
</p>

<p>
This feature makes Java suitable for web and cloud-based systems.
</p>
<h2>9. Dynamic</h2>

<p>
Java is dynamic in nature.
</p>

<p>
It supports:
<br>
✔ Dynamic class loading<br>
✔ Runtime linking<br>
✔ Runtime memory allocation
</p>

<p>
This allows Java applications to grow and adapt at runtime.
</p>
<h2>10. Architecture Neutral</h2>

<p>
Java does not depend on hardware architecture.
</p>

<p>
Bytecode is independent of:
<br>
✔ CPU type<br>
✔ Operating system<br>
✔ Hardware configuration
</p>

<p>
This ensures Java programs behave the same on all systems.
</p>
<h2>11. Portable</h2>

<p>
Java is portable because:
</p>

<p>
✔ Fixed-size data types<br>
✔ No platform-dependent features<br>
✔ JVM handles OS differences
</p>

<p>
A Java program can be moved from one system to another
without changing the code.
</p>
<h2>12. Automatic Memory Management</h2>

<p>
Java automatically manages memory using the <b>Garbage Collector</b>.
</p>

<p>
The garbage collector:
<br>
✔ Removes unused objects<br>
✔ Frees memory automatically<br>
✔ Prevents memory leaks
</p>

<p>
Programmers do not need to manually free memory.
</p>
<h2>13. Interpreted and Compiled</h2>

<p>
Java uses both compilation and interpretation.
</p>

<p>
✔ Source code is compiled into bytecode<br>
✔ Bytecode is interpreted by the JVM
</p>

<p>
This combination provides portability and performance.
</p>
<h2>Features of Java (Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
Java is simple, object-oriented, platform-independent, secure, robust,
multithreaded, portable, dynamic, and provides automatic memory management,
making it suitable for building reliable and scalable applications.
