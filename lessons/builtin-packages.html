<h2>Built-in Packages in Java</h2>

<p>
<b>Built-in Packages</b> are predefined packages
provided by Java to perform common programming tasks.
</p>

<p>
These packages are part of the
<b>Java API (Application Programming Interface)</b>.
</p>

<h2>What are Built-in Packages?</h2>

<p>
Built-in packages contain:
<br>
✔ Predefined classes<br>
✔ Interfaces<br>
✔ Utilities and helper methods
</p>

<p>
They reduce development time and
make Java powerful and developer-friendly.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Why Built-in Packages are Important?</h2>

<p>
Built-in packages:
<br>
✔ Avoid writing code from scratch<br>
✔ Provide tested and optimized code<br>
✔ Support platform-independent development<br>
✔ Help build enterprise-level applications
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Common Built-in Packages in Java</h2>

<p>
Some of the most frequently used built-in packages are:
</p>

<p>
✔ java.lang<br>
✔ java.util<br>
✔ java.io<br>
✔ java.sql<br>
✔ java.net<br>
✔ java.time
</p>

<hr>

<h2>java.lang Package</h2>

<p>
The <b>java.lang</b> package contains
fundamental classes required for Java programs.

✔ System<br>
✔ Wrapper classes (Integer, Double, etc.)
</p>

<hr>

<h2>java.util Package</h2>

<p>
The <b>java.util</b> package provides
utility classes and data structures.
</p>

<p>

input and output operations.
</p>

<p>
It supports:
<br>
✔ File handling<br>
✔ Byte streams<br>
✔ Character streams
</p>

<p>
Common classes:
<br>
✔ File<br>
✔ FileInputStream<br>
✔ FileOutputStream<br>
✔ BufferedReader<br>
✔ BufferedWriter
</p>

<hr>

<h2>java.sql Package</h2>

<p>
The <b>java.sql</b> package is used for
database connectivity using JDBC.
</p>

<p>
It allows Java programs to interact with databases.
</p>

<p>
Common interfaces/classes:
<br>
✔ Connection<br>
✔ Statement<br>
✔ PreparedStatement<br>
✔ ResultSet
</p>

<hr>

<h2>java.net Package</h2>

<p>
The <b>java.net</b> package supports
network programming.
</p>

<p>
Used for:
<br>
✔ Client-server applications<br>
✔ Network communication
</p>

<p>
Common classes:
<br>
✔ URL<br>
✔ Socket<br>
✔ ServerSocket
</p>

<hr>

<h2>java.time Package</h2>

<p>
The <b>java.time</b> package (Java 8+)
provides modern date and time APIs.
</p>

<p>
It is immutable and thread-safe.
</p>

<p>
Common classes:
<br>
✔ LocalDate<br>
✔ LocalTime<br>
✔ LocalDateTime<br>
✔ Period<br>
✔ Duration
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Importing Built-in Packages</h2>

<p>
There are three ways to use built-in packages:
</p>

<p>
✔ Import specific class<br>
import java.util.Scanner;
</p>

<p>
✔ Import entire package<br>
import java.util.*;
</p>

<p>
✔ Use fully qualified class name<br>
java.util.Scanner sc = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Advantages of Built-in Packages</h2>

<p>
✔ Faster development<br>
✔ Reliable and optimized code<br>
✔ Platform independent<br>
✔ Easy maintenance
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Real-Time Examples</h2>

<p>
✔ java.util → Collections in enterprise apps<br>
✔ java.io → File upload/download systems<br>
✔ java.sql → Database-driven applications<br>
✔ java.net → Web servers and APIs
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

<p>
✔ Forgetting to import required package<br>
✔ Confusing java.util.Date with java.sql.Date<br>
✔ Overusing wildcard imports
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Built-in Packages (Interview / Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
Built-in packages in Java are predefined packages
provided by the Java API that contain commonly
used classes and interfaces. They help developers
perform tasks such as file handling, collections,
database connectivity, networking, and date-time
operations efficiently without writing code
from scratch.
