<h2>Constructors in Java</h2>

<p>
A <b>Constructor</b> is a special method
used to <b>initialize objects</b> in Java.
</p>

<p>
It is automatically called when
an object of a class is created.
</p>

<h2>Key Features of Constructors</h2>

<p>
✔ Constructor name is same as class name<br>
✔ Constructor has no return type (not even void)<br>
✔ Called automatically during object creation<br>
✔ Used to initialize instance variables
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Why Do We Need Constructors?</h2>

<p>
Constructors are used to:
<br>
✔ Initialize object data<br>
✔ Allocate resources<br>
✔ Ensure object is created in a valid state
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Example of Constructor</h2>

<p>
class Student {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;int id;<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Student() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;id = 101;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}
</p>

<p>
Student s = new Student();
</p>

<p>
Here, the constructor initializes
the variable <b>id</b>.
</p>

<h2>Types of Constructors</h2>

<p>
Java mainly supports:
<br>
✔ Default Constructor<br>
✔ Parameterized Constructor
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Rules of Constructors</h2>

<p>
✔ Constructor cannot be static<br>
✔ Constructor cannot be abstract or final<br>
✔ Constructors can be overloaded<br>
✔ Constructor is not inherited
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Constructor Overloading</h2>

<p>
Multiple constructors with different
parameters in the same class
is called <b>Constructor Overloading</b>.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<p>
class Demo {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Demo() { }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Demo(int x) { }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Demo(int x, int y) { }<br>
}
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Constructor vs Method</h2>

<p>
✔ Constructor → Initializes object<br>
✔ Method → Performs operation<br><br>
✔ Constructor → Same name as class<br>
✔ Method → Any valid name<br><br>
✔ Constructor → No return type<br>
✔ Method → Has return type
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Real-Time Example</h2>

<p>
In real life:
<br>
✔ Mobile constructor initializes RAM, OS, Storage<br>
✔ Car constructor initializes engine, model, color
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

<p>
✔ Writing return type for constructor<br>
✔ Forgetting constructor name must match class<br>
✔ Thinking constructor is optional for initialization
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Constructors (Interview / Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
A constructor is a special method in Java
used to initialize objects. It has the same
name as the class, no return type, and is
automatically called when an object is created.
