<h2>String vs StringBuffer vs StringBuilder in Java</h2>

<p>
In Java, <b>String</b>, <b>StringBuffer</b>, and <b>StringBuilder</b>
are used to handle text data, but they differ in
<b>mutability, performance, and thread safety</b>.
</p>

<p>
Understanding these differences is very important
for writing efficient and industry‑level Java programs.
</p>

<h2>1. String</h2>

<p>
<b>String</b> is an immutable class.
Once a String object is created,
its value cannot be changed.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<p>
String s = "Java";<br>
s.concat(" Programming");<br>
System.out.println(s);
</p>

<p>
Output:
<br>
Java
</p>

<p>
Explanation:
<br>
✔ A new object is created<br>
✔ Original string remains unchanged
</p>

<h3>Features of String</h3>

<p>
✔ Immutable<br>
✔ Thread-safe (due to immutability)<br>
✔ Stored in String Constant Pool (literals)
</p>

<h2>2. StringBuffer</h2>

<p>
<b>StringBuffer</b> is a mutable class
used to modify strings without creating new objects.
</p>

<p>
It is <b>thread-safe</b> because its methods
are synchronized.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<p>
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Java");<br>
sb.append(" Programming");<br>
System.out.println(sb);
</p>

<p>
Output:
<br>
Java Programming
</p>

<h3>Features of StringBuffer</h3>

<p>
✔ Mutable<br>
✔ Thread-safe (synchronized)<br>
✔ Slower than StringBuilder
</p>

<h2>3. StringBuilder</h2>

<p>
<b>StringBuilder</b> is similar to StringBuffer,
but it is <b>not thread-safe</b>.
</p>

<p>
Because it is not synchronized,
it provides better performance.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<p>
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Java");<br>
sb.append(" Programming");<br>
System.out.println(sb);
</p>

<p>
Output:
<br>
Java Programming
</p>

<h3>Features of StringBuilder</h3>

<p>
✔ Mutable<br>
✔ Not thread-safe<br>
✔ Faster than String and StringBuffer
</p>

<h2>Key Differences</h2>

<h3>Mutability</h3>

<p>
✔ String → Immutable<br>
✔ StringBuffer → Mutable<br>
✔ StringBuilder → Mutable
</p>

<h3>Thread Safety</h3>

<p>
✔ String → Thread-safe (immutable)<br>
✔ StringBuffer → Thread-safe (synchronized)<br>
✔ StringBuilder → Not thread-safe
</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>
✔ Fastest → StringBuilder<br>
✔ Medium → StringBuffer<br>
✔ Slowest → String (for frequent modifications)
</p>

<h3>Memory</h3>

<p>
✔ String → More objects created on modification<br>
✔ StringBuffer / StringBuilder → Same object reused
</p>

<h2>Comparison Table (Conceptual)</h2>

<p>
String → Immutable, Secure, Slower for changes<br>
StringBuffer → Mutable, Thread-safe, Slower than Builder<br>
StringBuilder → Mutable, Fastest, Not thread-safe
</p>

<h2>When to Use What?</h2>

<p>
Use <b>String</b> when:
<br>
✔ Data does not change<br>
✔ Security is important<br>
✔ Read-only text is required
</p>

<p>
Use <b>StringBuffer</b> when:
<br>
✔ Application is multi-threaded<br>
✔ Thread safety is required<br>
✔ Frequent modifications are needed
</p>

<p>
Use <b>StringBuilder</b> when:
<br>
✔ Application is single-threaded<br>
✔ Performance is critical<br>
✔ Heavy string manipulation is needed
</p>

<h2>Real-Time Use Cases</h2>

<p>
✔ String → Usernames, passwords, constants<br>
✔ StringBuffer → Multi-threaded logging systems<br>
✔ StringBuilder → Loops, data formatting, reports
</p>

<h2>String vs StringBuffer vs StringBuilder (Interview / Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
String is immutable and thread-safe,
StringBuffer is mutable and thread-safe,
and StringBuilder is mutable and not thread-safe.
Among them, StringBuilder provides the best performance,
while StringBuffer is suitable for multi-threaded environments.
