<h2>Java vs C</h2>

<p>
Java and C are both popular programming languages,
but they are designed for different purposes.
</p>

<p>
C is a low-level procedural language,
while Java is a high-level object-oriented language.
</p>

<h2>Programming Paradigm</h2>

<p>
<b>C:</b><br>
✔ Procedural programming language<br>
✔ Focuses on functions and procedures
</p>

<p>
<b>Java:</b><br>
✔ Object-oriented programming language<br>
✔ Focuses on classes and objects
</p>

<h2>Platform Dependency</h2>

<p>
<b>C:</b><br>
✔ Platform dependent<br>
✔ Programs must be recompiled for each operating system
</p>

<p>
<b>Java:</b><br>
✔ Platform independent<br>
✔ Uses bytecode and JVM to run on any platform
</p>

<h2>Compilation and Execution</h2>

<p>
<b>C:</b><br>
✔ Source code is compiled directly into machine code<br>
✔ Executes faster because it runs directly on hardware
</p>

<p>
<b>Java:</b><br>
✔ Source code is compiled into bytecode<br>
✔ Bytecode is executed by JVM
</p>

<h2>Memory Management</h2>

<p>
<b>C:</b><br>
✔ Manual memory management<br>
✔ Uses malloc() and free()<br>
✔ Higher risk of memory leaks
</p>

<p>
<b>Java:</b><br>
✔ Automatic memory management<br>
✔ Uses Garbage Collector<br>
✔ Safer and more reliable
</p>

<h2>Pointers</h2>

<p>
<b>C:</b><br>
✔ Supports pointers<br>
✔ Allows direct memory access
</p>

<p>
<b>Java:</b><br>
✔ Does not support pointers directly<br>
✔ Improves security and stability
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>
<b>C:</b><br>
✔ Less secure<br>
✔ Vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks
</p>

<p>
<b>Java:</b><br>
✔ Highly secure<br>
✔ Uses bytecode verification and sandbox model
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>
<b>C:</b><br>
✔ Very high performance<br>
✔ Suitable for system-level programming
</p>

<p>
<b>Java:</b><br>
✔ Slightly slower than C<br>
✔ Performance improved using JIT compiler
</p>

<h2>Portability</h2>

<p>
<b>C:</b><br>
✔ Less portable<br>
✔ Code changes required for different systems
</p>

<p>
<b>Java:</b><br>
✔ Highly portable<br>
✔ Same bytecode runs on all platforms
</p>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>

<p>
<b>C is used for:</b><br>
✔ Operating systems<br>
✔ Embedded systems<br>
✔ Device drivers
</p>

<p>
<b>Java is used for:</b><br>
✔ Web applications<br>
✔ Mobile applications (Android)<br>
✔ Enterprise systems
</p>

<h2>Ease of Learning</h2>

<p>
<b>C:</b><br>
✔ Difficult for beginners<br>
✔ Requires understanding of memory and pointers
</p>

<p>
<b>Java:</b><br>
✔ Easier to learn<br>
✔ Automatic memory management helps beginners
</p>

<h2>Summary Table</h2>

<p>
✔ C is faster and closer to hardware<br>
✔ Java is safer, portable, and easier to maintain
</p>

<h2>Java vs C (Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent language
that uses JVM and garbage collection, whereas C is a low-level,
procedural, platform-dependent language that provides direct memory
access and higher performance but less security.
