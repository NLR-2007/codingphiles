<h2>Thread Priority in Java</h2>

<p>
<b>Thread Priority</b> in Java is used to
<b>suggest the order of execution</b> of
threads to the Thread Scheduler.
</p>

<p>
Threads with higher priority are generally
executed before threads with lower priority,
but this behavior depends on the JVM and OS.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>What is Thread Priority?</h2>

<p>
Thread priority is an integer value
associated with each thread that indicates
its importance.
</p>

<p>
✔ Higher priority → Higher chance of execution<br>
✔ Lower priority → Lower chance of execution
</p>

<p>
⚠ Priority does NOT guarantee execution order
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Priority Range in Java</h2>

<p>
Java defines thread priorities in the range:
</p>

<p>
✔ MIN_PRIORITY = 1<br>
✔ NORM_PRIORITY = 5 (default)<br>
✔ MAX_PRIORITY = 10
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Default Thread Priority</h2>

<p>
If no priority is set, a thread inherits
the priority of the thread that created it.
</p>

<p>
✔ Default priority = <b>5</b>
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Getting Thread Priority</h2>

<p>
The <b>getPriority()</b> method is used
to retrieve thread priority.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<p>
Thread t = Thread.currentThread();<br>
int p = t.getPriority();
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Setting Thread Priority</h2>

<p>
The <b>setPriority()</b> method is used
to change thread priority.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<p>
Thread t = new Thread();<br>
t.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
</p>

<p>
⚠ Value must be between 1 and 10<br>
Otherwise → IllegalArgumentException
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Example: Thread Priority</h2>

<p>
class MyThread extends Thread {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;public void run() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName());<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}<br><br>
class Test {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MyThread t1 = new MyThread();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MyThread t2 = new MyThread();<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t1.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t2.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t1.start();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t2.start();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Important Points</h2>

<p>
✔ Priority is only a hint to scheduler<br>
✔ JVM and OS decide actual execution<br>
✔ Do not rely on priority for program logic
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Thread Priority vs Scheduling</h2>

<p>
✔ Priority affects scheduling preference<br>
✔ Scheduling algorithm is platform dependent<br>
✔ Same priority threads may execute randomly
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Real‑Time Usage</h2>

<p>
✔ UI threads → Higher priority<br>
✔ Background logging → Lower priority<br>
✔ Monitoring services → Medium priority
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

<p>
✔ Assuming priority guarantees execution order<br>
✔ Using priority instead of synchronization<br>
✔ Setting invalid priority values
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Thread Priority (Interview / Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
Thread priority in Java is used to suggest
the execution order of threads to the scheduler.
Priorities range from 1 to 10, with 5 as the
default. Higher priority threads have a better
chance of execution, but priority does not
guarantee execution order as scheduling is
handled by the JVM and operating system.
