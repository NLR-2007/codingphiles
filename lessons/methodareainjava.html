<h2>Method Area in Java</h2>

<p>
<b>Method Area</b> is a part of JVM memory
used to store <b>class-level information</b>.
</p>

<p>
It stores data that is shared
among all objects of a class.
</p>

<h2>Why do we need Method Area?</h2>

<p>
Method Area is required to store
class-related data that is needed
throughout program execution.
</p>

<p>
Without Method Area:
<br>
✔ Classes cannot be loaded<br>
✔ Methods cannot be executed<br>
✔ Static data cannot be stored
</p>

<h2>What is Stored in Method Area?</h2>

<p>
Method Area stores:
</p>

<p>
✔ Class structure information<br>
✔ Method bytecode<br>
✔ Static variables<br>
✔ Constant pool<br>
✔ Method and constructor details
</p>

<h2>How Method Area Works</h2>

<p>
When a class is loaded by the JVM,
its information is stored in the Method Area.
</p>

<p>
This memory is created once per class,
not per object.
</p>

<h2>Method Area Example</h2>

<p>
class Student {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;static String college = "ABC College";<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;void display() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(college);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}
</p>

<p>
✔ Static variable <b>college</b> is stored in Method Area<br>
✔ Method <b>display()</b> code is stored in Method Area<br>
✔ Objects of Student are stored in heap
</p>

<h2>Characteristics of Method Area</h2>

<p>
✔ Stores class-level data<br>
✔ Shared across all threads<br>
✔ Created when class is loaded<br>
✔ Exists until JVM shuts down<br>
✔ Part of JVM memory
</p>

<h2>Method Area vs Heap Memory</h2>

<p>
<b>Method Area:</b><br>
✔ Stores class metadata<br>
✔ Stores static variables<br>
✔ One copy per class
</p>

<p>
<b>Heap Memory:</b><br>
✔ Stores objects<br>
✔ Stores instance variables<br>
✔ One copy per object
</p>

<h2>Method Area vs Stack Memory</h2>

<p>
<b>Method Area:</b><br>
✔ Stores class information<br>
✔ Shared memory<br>
✔ Long lifetime
</p>

<p>
<b>Stack Memory:</b><br>
✔ Stores local variables and method calls<br>
✔ Thread-specific<br>
✔ Short lifetime
</p>

<h2>Errors Related to Method Area</h2>

<p>
If Method Area runs out of memory,
the JVM throws:
<br>
<b>OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace</b>
</p>

<h2>Advantages of Method Area</h2>

<p>
✔ Efficient class-level memory usage<br>
✔ Avoids duplication of method code<br>
✔ Improves performance
</p>

<h2>Limitations of Method Area</h2>

<p>
✔ Limited memory size<br>
✔ Excessive class loading may cause errors<br>
✔ Static data stays till JVM ends
</p>

<h2>Real-Time Use Cases</h2>

<p>
Method Area is used for:
<br>
✔ Storing static variables<br>
✔ Loading class bytecode<br>
✔ Managing constants<br>
✔ Executing methods
</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

<p>
✔ Overusing static variables<br>
✔ Loading too many classes dynamically<br>
✔ Ignoring Metaspace size
</p>

<h2>Method Area (Interview / Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
Method Area in Java is a JVM memory region
used to store class-level information such as
method code, static variables, and constants.
It is shared among all threads and exists
until the JVM terminates.
