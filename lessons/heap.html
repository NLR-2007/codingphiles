<h2>Heap Memory in Java</h2>

<p>
<b>Heap Memory</b> is a runtime memory area
where <b>objects</b> and <b>instance variables</b>
are stored.
</p>

<p>
Heap memory is created when JVM starts
and is shared by all threads.
</p>

<h2>Why do we need Heap Memory?</h2>

<p>
Heap memory is needed to store objects
dynamically during program execution.
</p>

<p>
Without heap memory:
<br>
✔ Objects cannot be created<br>
✔ Data cannot be shared between methods
</p>

<h2>How Objects are Stored</h2>

<p>
Whenever we use the <b>new</b> keyword,
memory is allocated in heap.
</p>

<p>
Example:
<br>
Student s = new Student();
</p>

<p>
✔ Object → Heap Memory<br>
✔ Reference variable → Stack Memory
</p>

<h2>Heap Memory Features</h2>

<p>
✔ Stores objects<br>
✔ Large memory<br>
✔ Slower than stack<br>
✔ Managed by Garbage Collector
</p>

<h2>Heap Memory (Easy to Remember)</h2>

<p>
Heap memory stores <b>objects</b>
and lives till JVM runs.
</p>
