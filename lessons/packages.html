<h2>Packages in Java</h2>

<p>
A <b>Package</b> in Java is a namespace that
groups related classes and interfaces together.
</p>

<p>
It helps organize large programs into
logical units, similar to folders in a file system.
</p>

<h2>What is a Package?</h2>

<p>
A package is a collection of:
<br>
✔ Classes<br>
✔ Interfaces<br>
✔ Sub-packages
</p>

<p>
Example:
<br>
java.lang<br>
java.util<br>
java.io
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Why Do We Need Packages?</h2>

<p>
Packages are used to:
<br>
✔ Organize large applications<br>
✔ Avoid class name conflicts<br>
✔ Improve code readability<br>
✔ Provide access control and security<br>
✔ Support reusability
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Types of Packages in Java</h2>

<p>
Java supports two main types of packages:
</p>

<p>
✔ Built-in Packages<br>
✔ User-Defined Packages
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Built-in Packages</h2>

<p>
Built-in packages are provided by the
Java API (Application Programming Interface).
</p>

<p>
Common built-in packages:
<br>
✔ <b>java.lang</b> → Object, String, Math<br>
✔ <b>java.util</b> → ArrayList, Scanner, Date<br>
✔ <b>java.io</b> → File, InputStream, OutputStream<br>
✔ <b>java.sql</b> → JDBC classes
</p>

<p>
Note:
<br>
The <b>java.lang</b> package is imported automatically.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>User-Defined Packages</h2>

<p>
A <b>user-defined package</b> is created
by the programmer to organize application code.
</p>

<h3>Creating a Package</h3>

<p>
package mypackage;
</p>

<p>
Rules:
<br>
✔ Must be the first statement in the source file<br>
✔ Written before class definition
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
package mypack;<br><br>
public class Test {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;public void show() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Welcome to Packages");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Directory Structure of Package</h2>

<p>
Package name determines folder structure.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<p>
package com.company.project;
</p>

<p>
Creates directories:
<br>
com/company/project
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Accessing Classes from a Package</h2>

<p>
There are three ways to access a package:
</p>

<h3>1. Import a Specific Class</h3>

<p>
import java.util.Scanner;
</p>

<h3>2. Import Entire Package</h3>

<p>
import java.util.*;
</p>

<h3>3. Fully Qualified Name</h3>

<p>
java.util.Scanner sc = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Sub-Packages</h2>

<p>
A package inside another package
is called a <b>sub-package</b>.
</p>

<p>
Example:
<br>
java.util.concurrent
</p>

<p>
✔ util → parent package<br>
✔ concurrent → sub-package
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Advantages of Packages</h2>

<p>
✔ Better project structure<br>
✔ Avoids class name duplication<br>
✔ Improves security using access control<br>
✔ Easy maintenance and scalability
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Packages and Access Control</h2>

<p>
Packages work together with
<b>access modifiers</b> to control visibility.
</p>

<p>
✔ private → same class<br>
✔ default → same package<br>
✔ protected → same package + subclass<br>
✔ public → everywhere
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Real-Time Examples</h2>

<p>
✔ Banking app → account, loan, customer packages<br>
✔ Web app → controller, service, repository packages<br>
✔ Enterprise apps → layered architecture
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

<p>
✔ Writing package statement after imports<br>
✔ Forgetting directory structure<br>
✔ Overusing default package
</p>

<h2>Packages (Interview / Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
A package in Java is a namespace that groups
related classes and interfaces together. It helps
organize large applications, avoid naming conflicts,
and support access control and code reusability.
Packages can be built-in or user-defined.
