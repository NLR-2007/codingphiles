<h2>Java Compilation Process</h2>

<p>
The Java Compilation Process explains how a Java program
is converted from source code into bytecode before execution.
</p>

<p>
Compilation is the first major step in running a Java program.
</p>

<h2>Overview of Java Compilation</h2>

<p>
In Java, source code is not directly converted into machine code.
Instead, it is converted into an intermediate form called bytecode.
</p>

<p>
The main components involved in compilation are:
<br>
✔ Java Source Code (.java)<br>
✔ Java Compiler (javac)<br>
✔ Bytecode (.class)
</p>

<h2>Java Source Code</h2>

<p>
Java source code is written by the programmer
using the Java programming language.
</p>

<p>
Characteristics:
<br>
✔ Human readable<br>
✔ Saved with <b>.java</b> extension<br>
✔ Contains classes, methods, and statements
</p>

<h2>Java Compiler (javac)</h2>

<p>
The Java Compiler is a program that converts
Java source code into bytecode.
</p>

<p>
The compiler is provided by the Java Development Kit (JDK).
</p>

<h2>Functions of Java Compiler</h2>

<p>
The Java Compiler performs the following functions:
<br>
✔ Checks syntax errors<br>
✔ Checks type compatibility<br>
✔ Converts .java file into .class file<br>
✔ Generates platform‑independent bytecode
</p>

<h2>Bytecode Generation</h2>

<p>
Bytecode is an intermediate code generated after compilation.
</p>

<p>
Characteristics of Bytecode:
<br>
✔ Not machine dependent<br>
✔ Same for all operating systems<br>
✔ Executed only by JVM
</p>

<p>
Bytecode is the key reason for Java’s platform independence.
</p>

<h2>Steps in Java Compilation Process</h2>

<p>
The compilation process happens in the following steps:
</p>

<p>
<b>Step 1:</b> Programmer writes Java source code (.java file)<br>
<b>Step 2:</b> Java compiler (javac) reads the source code<br>
<b>Step 3:</b> Compiler checks syntax and semantic errors<br>
<b>Step 4:</b> Compiler generates bytecode (.class file)
</p>

<h2>Compilation Error</h2>

<p>
If the source code contains any syntax errors,
the compiler stops the compilation process.
</p>

<p>
Examples of compilation errors:
<br>
✔ Missing semicolon<br>
✔ Incorrect syntax<br>
✔ Type mismatch<br>
✔ Undeclared variables
</p>

<h2>Successful Compilation</h2>

<p>
If there are no errors in the source code,
the compiler successfully generates the .class file.
</p>

<p>
This .class file is then ready for execution by the JVM.
</p>

<h2>Role of JDK in Compilation</h2>

<p>
The Java Development Kit (JDK) provides:
<br>
✔ Java Compiler (javac)<br>
✔ Tools required for compilation
</p>

<p>
Without JDK, Java programs cannot be compiled.
</p>

<h2>Compilation vs Execution</h2>

<p>
<b>Compilation:</b> Converts source code into bytecode<br>
<b>Execution:</b> Runs bytecode using JVM
</p>

<p>
Both are separate processes in Java.
</p>

<h2>Advantages of Java Compilation Process</h2>

<p>
✔ Platform‑independent bytecode<br>
✔ Early error detection<br>
✔ Secure execution<br>
✔ Improved performance with JIT
</p>

<h2>Java Compilation Process (Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
Java Compilation is the process of converting Java source code
into platform‑independent bytecode using the Java compiler (javac),
which is later executed by the JVM.
