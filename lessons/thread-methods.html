<h2>Thread Methods in Java</h2>

<p>
The <b>Thread</b> class provides several
<b>methods</b> to control the execution,
behavior, and life cycle of threads.
</p>

<p>
These methods are essential for
<b>multithreading control</b>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Commonly Used Thread Methods</h2>

<p>
✔ start()<br>
✔ run()<br>
✔ sleep()<br>
✔ join()<br>
✔ yield()<br>
✔ setName()<br>
✔ getName()<br>
✔ setPriority()<br>
✔ getPriority()<br>
✔ isAlive()<br>
✔ currentThread()
</p>

<hr>

<h2>start()</h2>

<p>
The <b>start()</b> method begins execution
of a new thread.
</p>

<p>
✔ Creates a new thread<br>
✔ Internally calls run()
</p>

<p>
t.start();
</p>

<p>
⚠ start() can be called only once
</p>

<hr>

<h2>run()</h2>

<p>
The <b>run()</b> method contains the
code executed by the thread.
</p>

<p>
✔ Executed by JVM when start() is called<br>
✔ Calling run() directly does NOT create new thread
</p>

<hr>

<h2>sleep()</h2>

<p>
The <b>sleep()</b> method pauses the
current thread for a specified time.
</p>

<p>
Syntax:
</p>

<p>
Thread.sleep(milliseconds);
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
Thread.sleep(1000); // pauses for 1 second
</p>

<p>
✔ Throws InterruptedException<br>
✔ Thread goes to Blocked state
</p>

<hr>

<h2>join()</h2>

<p>
The <b>join()</b> method makes one thread
wait for another thread to finish.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
t1.join(); // main thread waits for t1
</p>

<p>
✔ Used for dependency control<br>
✔ Throws InterruptedException
</p>

<hr>

<h2>yield()</h2>

<p>
The <b>yield()</b> method pauses the
current thread and gives chance to
other threads of same priority.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<p>
Thread.yield();
</p>

<p>
✔ Suggestion to scheduler<br>
✔ No guarantee of execution order
</p>

<hr>

<h2>setName() and getName()</h2>

<p>
Used to set or get the name of a thread.
</p>

<p>
t.setName("WorkerThread");<br>
String name = t.getName();
</p>

<hr>

<h2>setPriority() and getPriority()</h2>

<p>
Thread priority determines execution preference.
</p>

<p>
Priority range:
<br>
✔ MIN_PRIORITY = 1<br>
✔ NORM_PRIORITY = 5<br>
✔ MAX_PRIORITY = 10
</p>

<p>
t.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
</p>

<p>
⚠ Priority depends on OS and JVM
</p>

<hr>

<h2>isAlive()</h2>

<p>
Checks whether a thread is alive.
</p>

<p>
✔ true → thread is running or ready<br>
✔ false → thread is terminated
</p>

<p>
t.isAlive();
</p>

<hr>

<h2>currentThread()</h2>

<p>
Returns reference to the currently
executing thread.
</p>

<p>
Thread t = Thread.currentThread();
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Deprecated Thread Methods</h2>

<p>
The following methods are deprecated
due to security issues:
</p>

<p>
✖ stop()<br>
✖ suspend()<br>
✖ resume()
</p>

<p>
⚠ Do NOT use these methods
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Thread Methods and Life Cycle</h2>

<p>
✔ start() → New → Runnable<br>
✔ sleep() → Running → Blocked<br>
✔ join() → Running → Waiting<br>
✔ run() end → Terminated
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Real‑Time Examples</h2>

<p>
✔ sleep() → Game animation delay<br>
✔ join() → Wait for file download<br>
✔ yield() → CPU sharing<br>
✔ isAlive() → Thread monitoring
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

<p>
✔ Calling run() instead of start()<br>
✔ Ignoring InterruptedException<br>
✔ Assuming thread priority guarantees order
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Thread Methods (Interview / Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
Thread methods in Java control thread
execution and behavior. Common methods
include start(), run(), sleep(), join(),
yield(), isAlive(), and currentThread().
These methods help manage thread life
cycle, synchronization, and execution
flow in multithreaded applications.
