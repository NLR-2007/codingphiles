<h2>Java Editions</h2>

<p>
Java Editions define different versions of Java
that are designed for different types of applications.
</p>

<p>
Each edition provides a specific set of libraries and tools
based on the application requirement.
</p>

<h2>Overview of Java Editions</h2>

<p>
Java is mainly divided into three major editions:
</p>

<p>
✔ Java SE (Standard Edition)<br>
✔ Java EE (Enterprise Edition)<br>
✔ Java ME (Micro Edition)
</p>

<p>
These editions help Java scale from small devices
to large enterprise applications.
</p>

<h2>Java SE (Standard Edition)</h2>

<p>
Java SE is the core and base edition of Java.
</p>

<p>
It provides the fundamental features required
to build standalone and desktop applications.
</p>

<p>
Java SE includes:
<br>
✔ Core Java APIs<br>
✔ Object-Oriented Programming concepts<br>
✔ Exception Handling<br>
✔ Multithreading<br>
✔ Collections Framework<br>
✔ File Handling<br>
✔ Networking
</p>

<p>
Java SE is required to learn before moving to
Advanced or Enterprise Java.
</p>

<h2>Applications of Java SE</h2>

<p>
✔ Desktop applications<br>
✔ Console-based programs<br>
✔ Core Java learning<br>
✔ Utility tools
</p>

<h2>Java EE (Enterprise Edition)</h2>

<p>
Java EE is built on top of Java SE.
</p>

<p>
It is used to develop large-scale,
distributed, and enterprise-level applications.
</p>

<p>
Java EE provides APIs for:
<br>
✔ Web applications<br>
✔ Server-side development<br>
✔ Database-driven applications<br>
✔ Transaction management<br>
✔ Security
</p>

<h2>Technologies in Java EE</h2>

<p>
✔ Servlets<br>
✔ JSP (Java Server Pages)<br>
✔ EJB (Enterprise Java Beans)<br>
✔ JPA (Java Persistence API)<br>
✔ Web Services
</p>

<p>
Java EE is widely used in banking,
e-commerce, and enterprise systems.
</p>

<h2>Java ME (Micro Edition)</h2>

<p>
Java ME is designed for small and resource-constrained devices.
</p>

<p>
It is used where memory, CPU, and power
availability are limited.
</p>

<p>
Java ME provides:
<br>
✔ Lightweight APIs<br>
✔ Device-specific libraries<br>
✔ Embedded system support
</p>

<h2>Applications of Java ME</h2>

<p>
✔ Mobile phones (older devices)<br>
✔ Embedded systems<br>
✔ IoT devices<br>
✔ Smart cards
</p>

<h2>Difference Between Java SE, EE, and ME</h2>

<p>
<b>Java SE:</b> Core Java, base edition, standalone applications<br>
<b>Java EE:</b> Enterprise-level, web & server-side applications<br>
<b>Java ME:</b> Small devices, embedded systems
</p>

<h2>Which Java Edition Should You Learn First?</h2>

<p>
✔ Start with <b>Java SE</b><br>
✔ Then learn <b>Java EE / Jakarta EE</b> for enterprise development<br>
✔ Learn <b>Java ME</b> only if working with embedded systems
</p>

<h2>Java Editions (Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
Java Editions include Java SE for core and standalone applications,
Java EE for enterprise and web-based applications,
and Java ME for mobile and embedded systems.
