<h2>JVM, JRE, and JDK</h2>

<p>
JVM, JRE, and JDK are the core components of the Java platform.
They work together to develop, run, and execute Java programs.
</p>

<p>
Understanding the difference between JVM, JRE, and JDK
is very important for learning Java.
</p>

<h2>Overview of JVM, JRE, and JDK</h2>

<p>
The Java platform consists of three main parts:
</p>

<p>
✔ JVM (Java Virtual Machine)<br>
✔ JRE (Java Runtime Environment)<br>
✔ JDK (Java Development Kit)
</p>

<p>
Each component has a specific role in Java program execution.
</p>

<h2>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</h2>

<p>
JVM stands for <b>Java Virtual Machine</b>.
</p>

<p>
It is an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment
to execute Java bytecode.
</p>

<p>
JVM is responsible for:
<br>
✔ Loading bytecode<br>
✔ Verifying bytecode<br>
✔ Executing bytecode<br>
✔ Managing memory
</p>

<h2>Functions of JVM</h2>

<p>
✔ Loads .class files into memory<br>
✔ Converts bytecode into machine code<br>
✔ Manages memory using Garbage Collection<br>
✔ Provides security using bytecode verification
</p>

<h2>JVM is Platform Dependent</h2>

<p>
JVM is platform dependent,
which means different operating systems have different JVM implementations.
</p>

<p>
However, Java programs remain platform independent
because the bytecode is the same for all platforms.
</p>

<h2>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</h2>

<p>
JRE stands for <b>Java Runtime Environment</b>.
</p>

<p>
It provides the environment required to run Java applications.
</p>

<p>
JRE contains:
<br>
✔ JVM<br>
✔ Core Java class libraries<br>
✔ Supporting files
</p>

<p>
JRE is used by end users who only want to run Java programs,
not develop them.
</p>

<h2>Components of JRE</h2>

<p>
✔ Java Virtual Machine (JVM)<br>
✔ Java core libraries (java.lang, java.util, etc.)<br>
✔ Runtime supporting files
</p>

<h2>Java Development Kit (JDK)</h2>

<p>
JDK stands for <b>Java Development Kit</b>.
</p>

<p>
It is used by developers to create, compile,
and run Java applications.
</p>

<p>
JDK contains:
<br>
✔ JRE<br>
✔ Java Compiler (javac)<br>
✔ Development tools
</p>

<h2>Tools Included in JDK</h2>

<p>
✔ javac – Java compiler<br>
✔ java – Java launcher<br>
✔ jar – Archive tool<br>
✔ javadoc – Documentation generator<br>
✔ jshell – Interactive Java shell
</p>

<h2>Relationship Between JVM, JRE, and JDK</h2>

<p>
✔ JVM is a part of JRE<br>
✔ JRE is a part of JDK
</p>

<p>
<b>JDK → JRE → JVM</b>
</p>

<p>
This means:
<br>
✔ JDK is the superset<br>
✔ JVM is the smallest unit
</p>

<h2>Difference Between JVM, JRE, and JDK</h2>

<p>
<b>JVM:</b> Executes bytecode, platform dependent<br>
<b>JRE:</b> Provides runtime environment, used to run programs<br>
<b>JDK:</b> Provides development tools, used to create programs
</p>

<h2>Who Needs JVM, JRE, and JDK?</h2>

<p>
✔ Developer needs <b>JDK</b><br>
✔ User needs <b>JRE</b><br>
✔ Java program runs inside <b>JVM</b>
</p>

<h2>Real‑World Example</h2>

<p>
✔ Writing code → JDK<br>
✔ Running code → JRE<br>
✔ Executing code → JVM
</p>

<h2>Advantages of JVM, JRE, and JDK</h2>

<p>
✔ Platform independence<br>
✔ Secure execution<br>
✔ Automatic memory management<br>
✔ Easy development and execution
</p>

<h2>JVM, JRE, and JDK (Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
JVM executes Java bytecode, JRE provides the runtime environment,
and JDK provides development tools.
Together, they form the Java platform that enables
platform‑independent, secure, and efficient Java program execution.
