<h2>History of Java</h2>

<p>
The history of Java explains how the Java programming language was created,
why it was developed, and how it became one of the most popular programming
languages in the world.
</p>

<p>
Java was designed to solve problems related to portability, security,
and reliability in software development.
</p>
<h2>Why Java Was Needed?</h2>

<p>
Before Java, most programming languages had serious limitations:
</p>

<p>
✔ Programs were platform dependent<br>
✔ Same code could not run on different operating systems<br>
✔ Software was difficult to maintain<br>
✔ Security was weak for network-based applications
</p>

<p>
Developers had to rewrite the same program for Windows, Linux, and Mac.
This was time-consuming and expensive.
</p>
<h2>The Green Project (1991)</h2>

<p>
In 1991, a team of engineers at Sun Microsystems started a secret research
project called the <b>Green Project</b>.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this project was to create a programming language that could:
<br>
✔ Run on any device<br>
✔ Work on embedded systems<br>
✔ Be secure and reliable<br>
✔ Support network-based applications
</p>
<h2>James Gosling – Creator of Java</h2>

<p>
Java was created by <b>James Gosling</b>, a computer scientist working at
Sun Microsystems.
</p>

<p>
James Gosling is known as the <b>Father of Java</b>.
He designed Java with simplicity, portability, and security in mind.
</p>

<p>
His idea was to create a language that works the same on all machines.
</p>
<h2>Oak – The Original Name</h2>

<p>
The original name of Java was <b>Oak</b>.
</p>

<p>
It was named after an oak tree outside James Gosling’s office.
</p>

<p>
Oak was designed for interactive television and embedded devices,
but it was too advanced for the hardware available at that time.
</p>
<h2>Why Oak Failed Initially</h2>

<p>
Oak was a powerful language, but it failed in the early 1990s because:
</p>

<p>
✔ Embedded device market was small<br>
✔ Hardware was not powerful enough<br>
✔ No strong commercial demand at that time
</p>

<p>
As a result, the Oak project was temporarily stopped.
</p>
<h2>Birth of Java (1995)</h2>

<p>
In 1995, the rise of the <b>Internet and World Wide Web</b> changed everything.
</p>

<p>
Sun Microsystems realized that Oak was perfect for web-based applications.
So Oak was renamed as <b>Java</b>.
</p>

<p>
Java was officially released in 1995 by Sun Microsystems.
</p>
<h2>Why the Name Java?</h2>

<p>
The name Java was chosen during a coffee break discussion.
</p>

<p>
Java is a type of coffee, and the developers were heavy coffee drinkers.
</p>

<p>
That is why Java’s logo is a <b>coffee cup</b>.
</p>
<h2>Java and the Internet Boom</h2>

<p>
Java became popular because it supported:
</p>

<p>
✔ Web-based applications<br>
✔ Network programming<br>
✔ Applets (small programs that run in browsers)<br>
✔ Secure execution inside browsers
</p>

<p>
Java applets made websites interactive in the early days of the internet.
</p>
<h2>Write Once, Run Anywhere</h2>

<p>
Java introduced the revolutionary concept:
<br>
<b>Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)</b>
</p>

<p>
Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any system
that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
</p>

<p>
This feature made Java extremely popular.
</p>
<h2>Java in Enterprise Systems</h2>

<p>
After its success on the web, Java was adopted by large companies.
</p>

<p>
Java became popular in:
<br>
✔ Banking systems<br>
✔ Insurance companies<br>
✔ Government applications<br>
✔ Large-scale enterprise software
</p>

<p>
Java was stable, secure, and scalable for big applications.
</p>
<h2>Evolution of Java</h2>

<p>
Java evolved continuously with new versions:
</p>

<p>
✔ Java 1.0 – First release (1995)<br>
✔ Java 2 – Introduced enterprise features<br>
✔ Java SE, EE, ME – Different editions<br>
✔ Modern Java – Cloud, microservices, and AI
</p>

<p>
Each version improved performance, security, and features.
</p>
<h2>Oracle and Java</h2>

<p>
In 2010, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems.
</p>

<p>
After this acquisition, Java became a product maintained by Oracle.
</p>

<p>
Oracle continues to develop, update, and secure Java.
</p>
<h2>Java Today</h2>

<p>
Today, Java is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.
</p>

<p>
Java is used in:
<br>
✔ Android development<br>
✔ Web and backend systems<br>
✔ Cloud computing<br>
✔ Big data and AI systems
</p>
<h2>History of Java (Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995,
originally named Oak, and was designed to be a platform-independent,
secure, and portable programming language.
