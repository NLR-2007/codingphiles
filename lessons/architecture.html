<h2>Java Architecture</h2>

<p>
Java Architecture explains how a Java program is compiled, loaded,
and executed inside a computer system.
</p>

<p>
It shows the interaction between:
<br>
✔ Java Source Code<br>
✔ Compiler<br>
✔ JVM (Java Virtual Machine)<br>
✔ Operating System<br>
✔ Hardware
</p>
<h2>Overview of Java Architecture</h2>

<p>
Java follows a layered architecture that makes it platform independent.
</p>

<p>
The main components are:
<br>
✔ Java Source Code (.java)<br>
✔ Java Compiler (javac)<br>
✔ Bytecode (.class)<br>
✔ JVM (Java Virtual Machine)<br>
✔ Operating System & Hardware
</p>
<h2>Java Program Execution Flow</h2>

<p>
The execution of a Java program happens in the following steps:
</p>

<p>
<b>Step 1:</b> Programmer writes Java source code (.java file)<br>
<b>Step 2:</b> Java compiler converts source code into bytecode (.class file)<br>
<b>Step 3:</b> Bytecode is loaded into JVM<br>
<b>Step 4:</b> JVM converts bytecode into machine code<br>
<b>Step 5:</b> Machine code is executed by the operating system
</p>
<h2>Java Compiler (javac)</h2>

<p>
The Java compiler converts Java source code into bytecode.
</p>

<p>
Functions of Java Compiler:
<br>
✔ Checks syntax errors<br>
✔ Converts .java file into .class file<br>
✔ Produces platform-independent bytecode
</p>
<h2>Java Bytecode</h2>

<p>
Bytecode is an intermediate code generated by the Java compiler.
</p>

<p>
Characteristics of Bytecode:
<br>
✔ Not machine dependent<br>
✔ Same for all platforms<br>
✔ Executed only by JVM
</p>

<p>
Bytecode is the main reason for Java’s platform independence.
</p>
<h2>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</h2>

<p>
JVM is the heart of Java architecture.
</p>

<p>
It is responsible for executing Java bytecode
and converting it into machine-specific instructions.
</p>
<h2>Components of JVM</h2>

<p>
The JVM consists of the following main components:
</p>

<p>
✔ Class Loader Subsystem<br>
✔ Runtime Data Areas<br>
✔ Execution Engine<br>
✔ Native Method Interface (JNI)<br>
✔ Native Method Libraries
</p>
<h2>Class Loader Subsystem</h2>

<p>
The Class Loader loads .class files into JVM memory.
</p>

<p>
Types of Class Loaders:
<br>
✔ Bootstrap Class Loader<br>
✔ Extension Class Loader<br>
✔ Application Class Loader
</p>

<p>
It also performs bytecode verification for security.
</p>
<h2>Runtime Data Areas</h2>

<p>
Runtime Data Areas are memory areas created during program execution.
</p>

<p>
They include:
<br>
✔ Method Area – Class metadata<br>
✔ Heap Area – Objects and instances<br>
✔ Stack Area – Method calls and local variables<br>
✔ PC Register – Instruction address<br>
✔ Native Method Stack – Native code execution
</p>
<h2>Execution Engine</h2>

<p>
The Execution Engine executes bytecode instructions.
</p>

<p>
It consists of:
<br>
✔ Interpreter – Executes bytecode line by line<br>
✔ JIT Compiler – Improves performance by compiling bytecode to machine code<br>
✔ Garbage Collector – Frees unused memory
</p>
<h2>Garbage Collector</h2>

<p>
Garbage Collector automatically manages memory in Java.
</p>

<p>
Functions:
<br>
✔ Identifies unused objects<br>
✔ Deletes them from heap memory<br>
✔ Prevents memory leaks
</p>

<p>
This makes Java memory-safe and developer-friendly.
</p>
<h2>Java Native Interface (JNI)</h2>

<p>
JNI allows Java programs to interact with native applications
written in C or C++.
</p>

<p>
It is used when Java needs to access hardware-level features.
</p>
<h2>JRE and JDK in Java Architecture</h2>

<p>
<b>JRE (Java Runtime Environment)</b> contains:
<br>
✔ JVM<br>
✔ Core libraries
</p>

<p>
<b>JDK (Java Development Kit)</b> contains:
<br>
✔ JRE<br>
✔ Compiler (javac)<br>
✔ Development tools
</p>
<h2>Java Architecture Diagram Explanation</h2>

<p>
Java source code is compiled into bytecode by the compiler.
The bytecode is loaded into the JVM using the class loader.
The execution engine executes the bytecode with help of runtime
memory areas and garbage collector.
Finally, the machine code runs on the operating system.
</p>
<h2>Advantages of Java Architecture</h2>

<p>
✔ Platform independence<br>
✔ High security<br>
✔ Automatic memory management<br>
✔ High performance using JIT<br>
✔ Scalable and robust
</p>
<h2>Java Architecture (Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
Java Architecture consists of the Java compiler, bytecode, JVM,
class loader, runtime memory areas, and execution engine,
which together provide platform independence, security,
and efficient execution of Java programs.
