<h2>private Access Modifier in Java</h2>

<p>
The <b>private</b> access modifier is used
to restrict access to class members.
</p>

<p>
A <b>private</b> member is accessible
<b>only within the same class</b>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>What is private?</h2>

<p>
The <b>private</b> keyword is the
<b>most restrictive</b> access modifier in Java.
</p>

<p>
It is mainly used for:
<br>
✔ Data hiding<br>
✔ Security<br>
✔ Encapsulation
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Where Can private Be Used?</h2>

<p>
The <b>private</b> access modifier can be applied to:
</p>

<p>
✔ Variables<br>
✔ Methods<br>
✔ Constructors
</p>

<p>
Note:
<br>
Classes themselves cannot be private.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>private Variables</h2>

<p>
When a variable is declared as private,
it cannot be accessed directly outside the class.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
class Student {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;private int age;<br>
}
</p>

<p>
✔ age is hidden from outside access
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Accessing private Variables</h2>

<p>
Private variables are accessed using
<b>public getter and setter methods</b>.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
class Student {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;private int age;<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;public void setAge(int age) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(age > 0) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.age = age;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;public int getAge() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return age;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}
</p>

<hr>

<h2>private Methods</h2>

<p>
A <b>private method</b> can be accessed
only within the same class.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
class Demo {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;private void show() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Private Method");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;void call() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;show();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}
</p>

<p>
✔ show() cannot be called from another class
</p>

<hr>

<h2>private Constructor</h2>

<p>
A <b>private constructor</b> prevents
object creation from outside the class.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
class Singleton {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;private Singleton() { }<br>
}
</p>

<p>
Used in:
<br>
✔ Singleton Design Pattern<br>
✔ Utility classes
</p>

<hr>

<h2>private and Inheritance</h2>

<p>
Private members are <b>not inherited</b>
by child classes.
</p>

<p>
✔ Child class cannot access private members<br>
✔ They belong strictly to the parent class
</p>

<hr>

<h2>private vs Other Access Modifiers</h2>

<p>
✔ private → Same class only<br>
✔ default → Same package<br>
✔ protected → Same package + subclass<br>
✔ public → Anywhere
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Advantages of private</h2>

<p>
✔ Strong data security<br>
✔ Supports encapsulation<br>
✔ Prevents unauthorized access<br>
✔ Improves maintainability
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Real-Time Examples</h2>

<p>
✔ BankAccount → balance is private<br>
✔ ATM → PIN is private<br>
✔ Employee → salary is private
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

<p>
✔ Trying to access private members outside class<br>
✔ Forgetting getters and setters<br>
✔ Assuming private members are inherited
</p>

<hr>

<h2>private (Interview / Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
The <b>private</b> access modifier in Java
restricts access to class members so that
they are accessible only within the same class.
It is mainly used for data hiding and supports
encapsulation by preventing direct access to
internal variables and methods.
