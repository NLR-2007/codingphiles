<h2>Java Buzz Words</h2>

<p>
Java Buzz Words describe the main features and characteristics
that define the nature, strength, and behavior of the Java programming language.
</p>

<p>
They explain why Java is:
<br>
✔ Popular<br>
✔ Powerful<br>
✔ Platform Independent<br>
✔ Secure and Robust
</p>

<h2>Overview of Java Buzz Words</h2>

<p>
Java was designed with several important goals in mind.
These goals are expressed as Java Buzz Words.
</p>

<p>
The major Java Buzz Words are:
<br>
✔ Simple<br>
✔ Object-Oriented<br>
✔ Platform Independent<br>
✔ Architecture Neutral<br>
✔ Portable<br>
✔ Secure<br>
✔ Robust<br>
✔ Multithreaded<br>
✔ High Performance<br>
✔ Distributed<br>
✔ Dynamic<br>
✔ Interpreted
</p>

<h2>Simple</h2>

<p>
Java is easy to learn and easy to use.
</p>

<p>
Reasons:
<br>
✔ Simple syntax<br>
✔ No complex pointers<br>
✔ Automatic memory management<br>
✔ Rich standard library
</p>

<h2>Object-Oriented</h2>

<p>
Java follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
</p>

<p>
It supports:
<br>
✔ Class and Object<br>
✔ Encapsulation<br>
✔ Inheritance<br>
✔ Polymorphism<br>
✔ Abstraction
</p>

<p>
This makes Java programs modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.
</p>

<h2>Platform Independent</h2>

<p>
Java follows the principle:
</p>

<p>
<b>Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)</b>
</p>

<p>
Java source code is compiled into bytecode,
which can run on any operating system using JVM.
</p>

<h2>Architecture Neutral</h2>

<p>
Java programs are not dependent on any specific hardware architecture.
</p>

<p>
Reasons:
<br>
✔ Fixed size data types<br>
✔ Same bytecode for all systems
</p>

<p>
This ensures consistent behavior on all platforms.
</p>

<h2>Portable</h2>

<p>
Java programs can be easily moved from one system to another.
</p>

<p>
Reasons:
<br>
✔ Platform-independent bytecode<br>
✔ No system-specific features
</p>

<h2>Secure</h2>

<p>
Java provides a strong security model.
</p>

<p>
Security features include:
<br>
✔ No pointer access<br>
✔ Bytecode Verifier<br>
✔ Class Loader<br>
✔ Security Manager
</p>

<p>
These features protect Java programs from malicious attacks.
</p>

<h2>Robust</h2>

<p>
Java is designed to handle errors efficiently.
</p>

<p>
Reasons:
<br>
✔ Strong exception handling<br>
✔ Automatic garbage collection<br>
✔ Strong memory management
</p>

<p>
This reduces system crashes and runtime errors.
</p>

<h2>Multithreaded</h2>

<p>
Java supports multithreading,
which allows multiple tasks to run simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
Benefits:
<br>
✔ Better CPU utilization<br>
✔ Faster execution<br>
✔ Useful in games, servers, and real-time applications
</p>

<h2>High Performance</h2>

<p>
Java achieves high performance using the JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler.
</p>

<p>
The JIT compiler converts bytecode into machine code at runtime,
which improves execution speed.
</p>

<h2>Distributed</h2>

<p>
Java supports distributed computing.
</p>

<p>
It provides APIs like:
<br>
✔ RMI (Remote Method Invocation)<br>
✔ Socket Programming
</p>

<p>
This makes Java suitable for network-based applications.
</p>

<h2>Dynamic</h2>

<p>
Java is dynamic in nature.
</p>

<p>
Features:
<br>
✔ Classes loaded at runtime<br>
✔ Supports Reflection<br>
✔ Easy to extend applications
</p>

<h2>Interpreted</h2>

<p>
Java bytecode is interpreted by the JVM.
</p>

<p>
Execution happens line by line,
making Java platform independent.
</p>

<h2>Advantages of Java Buzz Words</h2>

<p>
✔ Easy development<br>
✔ High security<br>
✔ Platform independence<br>
✔ Better performance<br>
✔ Scalable applications
</p>

<h2>Java Buzz Words (Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
Java Buzz Words are the key features of Java such as
simple, object-oriented, platform independent, secure,
robust, multithreaded, and dynamic, which together make
Java a powerful and widely used programming language.
