<h2>Stack Memory in Java</h2>

<p>
<b>Stack Memory</b> is a runtime memory area in Java
used to store <b>method calls</b>, <b>local variables</b>,
and <b>reference variables</b>.
</p>

<p>
Stack memory follows the <b>LIFO</b> principle
(Last In, First Out).
</p>

<h2>Why do we need Stack Memory?</h2>

<p>
Stack memory is required to manage method execution
and store temporary data during program execution.
</p>

<p>
Without stack memory:
<br>
✔ Method calls cannot be tracked<br>
✔ Local variables cannot be stored<br>
✔ Program execution flow breaks
</p>

<h2>What is Stored in Stack Memory?</h2>

<p>
Stack memory stores:
</p>

<p>
✔ Method call information<br>
✔ Local variables<br>
✔ Reference variables to heap objects<br>
✔ Return addresses
</p>

<h2>How Stack Memory Works</h2>

<p>
Each time a method is called,
a <b>stack frame</b> is created.
</p>

<p>
When the method finishes execution,
its stack frame is removed automatically.
</p>

<p>
This process is known as
<b>push</b> and <b>pop</b>.
</p>

<h2>Stack Memory Example</h2>

<p>
class Test {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;void display() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int a = 10;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(a);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Test t = new Test();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t.display();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}
</p>

<p>
✔ Variable <b>a</b> is stored in stack memory<br>
✔ Reference <b>t</b> is stored in stack memory<br>
✔ Object <b>Test</b> is stored in heap memory
</p>

<h2>Characteristics of Stack Memory</h2>

<p>
✔ Stores method calls and local variables<br>
✔ Each thread has its own stack<br>
✔ Faster access compared to heap<br>
✔ Memory is automatically allocated and deallocated<br>
✔ Fixed size
</p>

<h2>Stack Overflow Error</h2>

<p>
When stack memory is full,
the JVM throws a <b>StackOverflowError</b>.
</p>

<p>
Common causes:
<br>
✔ Infinite recursion<br>
✔ Too many nested method calls
</p>

<h2>Stack Memory vs Heap Memory</h2>

<p>
<b>Stack Memory:</b><br>
✔ Stores local variables and method calls<br>
✔ Faster access<br>
✔ Limited size
</p>

<p>
<b>Heap Memory:</b><br>
✔ Stores objects and instance variables<br>
✔ Slower access<br>
✔ Larger size
</p>

<h2>Advantages of Stack Memory</h2>

<p>
✔ Very fast memory access<br>
✔ Automatic memory management<br>
✔ No memory leaks
</p>

<h2>Limitations of Stack Memory</h2>

<p>
✔ Limited size<br>
✔ Cannot store objects<br>
✔ Stack overflow may occur
</p>

<h2>Real-Time Use Cases</h2>

<p>
Stack memory is used for:
<br>
✔ Method execution tracking<br>
✔ Function calls<br>
✔ Storing local variables<br>
✔ Managing recursion
</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

<p>
✔ Infinite recursion<br>
✔ Large local variables<br>
✔ Deeply nested method calls
</p>

<h2>Stack Memory (Interview / Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
Stack memory in Java is a runtime memory area
used to store method calls, local variables,
and reference variables. It follows LIFO
and provides fast memory access.
