<h2>Structure of Java Program</h2>

<p>
The structure of a Java program defines
how a Java program is organized and written.
</p>

<p>
Every Java program follows a predefined structure
so that the JVM can understand and execute it correctly.
</p>

<h2>Basic Structure of a Java Program</h2>

<p>
A Java program generally consists of:
<br>
✔ Package statement (optional)<br>
✔ Import statements (optional)<br>
✔ Class declaration<br>
✔ main() method<br>
✔ Program statements
</p>

<h2>General Syntax</h2>

<p>
class ClassName {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// program statements<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}
</p>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

<p>
✔ <b>Class:</b> Contains program logic<br>
✔ <b>main() method:</b> Entry point of execution<br>
✔ <b>Statements:</b> Instructions executed by JVM
</p>

<h2>Structure of Java Program (Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
A Java program consists of a class
containing the main() method,
which acts as the starting point of execution.
