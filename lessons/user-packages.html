<h2>User-Defined Packages in Java</h2>

<p>
A <b>User-Defined Package</b> is a package
created by the programmer to organize
application-specific classes and interfaces.
</p>

<p>
It helps structure large projects in a
clean, modular, and maintainable way.
</p>

<h2>What is a User-Defined Package?</h2>

<p>
A user-defined package is created using
the <b>package</b> keyword.
</p>

<p>
It allows developers to group related
classes under a custom namespace.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Why Do We Need User-Defined Packages?</h2>

<p>
User-defined packages are used to:
<br>
✔ Organize large applications<br>
✔ Avoid class name conflicts<br>
✔ Improve code readability<br>
✔ Support access control and security<br>
✔ Enable reuse of classes
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Creating a User-Defined Package</h2>

<p>
To create a package, use the <b>package</b>
statement at the top of the source file.
</p>

<p>
Syntax:
</p>

<p>
package packageName;
</p>

<p>
Rules:
<br>
✔ Must be the first statement in the file<br>
✔ Written before imports and class definition
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Example: Creating a Package</h2>

<p>
package mypack;<br><br>
public class Test {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;public void show() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("User-defined Package Example");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Directory Structure of User-Defined Package</h2>

<p>
The package name determines the folder structure.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<p>
package com.company.project;
</p>

<p>
This creates the directory structure:
<br>
com/company/project
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Compiling User-Defined Package</h2>

<p>
To compile a package and create directories automatically:
</p>

<p>
javac -d . Test.java
</p>

<p>
✔ -d → specifies destination directory<br>
✔ . → current directory
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Accessing User-Defined Package</h2>

<p>
There are three ways to access classes
from a user-defined package:
</p>

<h3>1. Import Specific Class</h3>

<p>
import mypack.Test;
</p>

<h3>2. Import Entire Package</h3>

<p>
import mypack.*;
</p>

<h3>3. Fully Qualified Name</h3>

<p>
mypack.Test t = new mypack.Test();
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Using Package with Access Modifiers</h2>

<p>
Access modifiers control visibility across packages:
</p>

<p>
✔ private → same class only<br>
✔ default → same package only<br>
✔ protected → same package + subclass<br>
✔ public → accessible from anywhere
</p>

<p>
For cross-package access:
<br>
✔ Class and methods must be <b>public</b>
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Sub-Packages</h2>

<p>
A package inside another package
is called a <b>sub-package</b>.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<p>
package com.company.project.module;
</p>

<p>
✔ com.company.project → parent package<br>
✔ module → sub-package
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Advantages of User-Defined Packages</h2>

<p>
✔ Better project organization<br>
✔ Improves maintainability<br>
✔ Enhances security using access control<br>
✔ Supports large-scale development
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Real-Time Examples</h2>

<p>
✔ Banking app → account, loan, customer packages<br>
✔ Web app → controller, service, repository packages<br>
✔ Enterprise apps → layered architecture
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

<p>
✔ Writing package statement after imports<br>
✔ Forgetting to compile with -d option<br>
✔ Using default package in large projects
</p>

<hr>

<h2>User-Defined Packages (Interview / Exam Ready)</h2>

<p>
A user-defined package in Java is created
by the programmer using the <b>package</b> keyword
to group related classes and interfaces. It helps
organize code, avoid naming conflicts, improve
security through access control, and support
scalable application development.
